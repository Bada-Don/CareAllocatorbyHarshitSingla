This is my website named "CareAllocator". 

The main motive of this website was to serve as a platform where 
all the available doctors of different specializations can be found 
and can be contacted by the patients.

The website is designed to provide a platform where patients can
Search for doctors based on their requirements, distance, consultation fee,
ratings, and other factors, and will be able to book their slip number
(I don't know the better word for this).

The thing that will make this website different from others is that our website will be able to track the number of patients 
in the waitlist, and the AI system deployed will learn gradually how much 
time is generally required for each doctor to complete the consultation/treatment.
The applications already available in the market allow only booking the slot/appointment time which is generally not applicable in the tier 2
cities with small clinics. Thus booking slip no. is better, so that next patients gets pushed further in the queue, and avoids wastage of time.

Patients will be able to book the slip online and offline mode, the slip no. will be updated on the server, and will be terminated by the doctor after 
treatment.

Currently, this is a multipage website but whenever the admin (me) masters the MERN, he will make this better.
